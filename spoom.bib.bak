  Abstract                 = {Recently, Harn and Lin introduced a notion of strong t-consistency of a (t, n) secret sharing scheme and proposed a strong (n, t, n) verifiable secret sharing (VSS). In this paper, we propose a strong (n, t, n) VSS which is more efficient than Harn and Lin's VSS. Using the same approach, we propose a (n, t, n) multi-secret sharing scheme (MSS) to allow shareholders to share n-t+1 secrets. Also, the proposed (n, t, n) MSS can be modified to include the verifiable feature. All proposed schemes are unconditionally secure and are based on Shamir's (t, n) secret sharing scheme.},
